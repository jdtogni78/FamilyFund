# Family Fund
A simple system to manage fund shares and composition.

## Objective and Goals

The objective is to create a first MVP of a fund shares management system.
* First goal in to have minimal functionality. 
* No graphical interface (manual inputs for most, some command line parameters and one API).
* Focus on code quality, good OO/separation of concepts 
* Use Java or PHP.
* Use Frameworks/ORM: Java Spring/Hibernate or some PHP Framework (Symfony/Laravel/Composer).
* Documentation with JavaDoc for Java (https://dzone.com/articles/best-practices-of-code-documentation-in-java) or similar (Doxygen?) for PHP.
* The database must be  MariaDB or MySQL. Use TLS 1.2 connection.
* Unit tests with good coverage, using TestNG or similar.
* Deliverable should be Docker-compose setup 
 * With separate DB and app servers
 * Ability to run tests & coverage analysis
* The delivery should be in phases, allowing for review.

## Versions
### V1 
#### Infrastructure:
* Docker setup
 * DB Server
 * App Server: unix, java or php

* Data Input: API
* Assets have a price history (asset, price, date)

#### Portfolio
* What: represents a collection of investments on assets
* Input: CRUD API
* Has assets
* Each asset, for a portfolio: 
 * has id, quantity/shares
 * can calculate % of portfolio
* Can calculate total value
* Assets can only be registered once in a portfolio
* Changes are tracked on fund changelog or 

#### Funds (Investment Fund)
* What: Associates a portfolio to fund holders and their shares.
* Input: CRUD API
* Have name, goal(long text), total shares (double)
* Has one portfolio
* It can calculate its total value based on its portfolio
* It can calculate the fund share price

### Fund Changelog
* All changes to funds and portfolio should be tracked 
* Track: changes to funds, changes to portfolios

### V2

#### Funds (Updates)
* Have sale restriction (%)
* Has matching rules
* It can calculate the unallocated funds (that donâ€™t belong to Fund Holders)

#### Matching Rules
* Has Name, $ range, date period, match(%)
* Matching rules are global, independent of funds and portfolios

#### Fund Share Holders
* Name, email, type (person/reserve)
* CC email list (comma separated text, optional)

#### Fund Holder Shares
* Has Fund Holder, share type (purchase, borrow, sale), portfolio asset id, shares (double)
* Have shares of Funds (not assets)
 * All changes should be tracked in a Fund Holder share history
* Have borrowed shares of Funds - and a historical table

### V3

#### Infrastructure
* SMS Setup
* PDF Generation

#### Fund Holder Quarterly Report
* Report will be triggered by command line
* Output is PDF
* Will be sent via email 
* Matching rule status (if borrowing or sales last year, shows as on not available)
* Borrowing status
* Sale Restriction % 
* Overall Fund Performance (includes line graph)
* Last Year Fund Performance
* Total shares/value

#### Fund Share Transactions
