    * min fund performance % - restrict (growth - min fund perf)

### V3
#### Infrastructure
* SMS Setup
* PDF Generation

#### Fund Holder Quarterly Report

* PDF Content
    * Matching rule status (if borrowing or sales last year, shows as on not available)

* Sales
    * Restricted by the Fund (max %)
* Borrowing
 * Reduce Fund Holder shares, add borrowing shares

### V4

* API Should be documented with Swagger

#### API ACL
* What: controls access to API
* Data Input: Manual
* Fields: Has roles, permissions (read/write), api/page/command line flag, URI
