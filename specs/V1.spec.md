# Family Fund
A simple system to manage fund shares and composition.

## Objective and Goals

The objective is to create a first MVP of a fund shares management system.
* ~~First goal in to have minimal functionality.~~
* ~~No graphical interface (manual inputs for some, API for others).~~
* ~~Focus on code quality, good OO/separation of concepts~~
* ~~Use PHP/Laravel~~ DONE
* ~~The database will be MariaDB~~ DONE
* Use TLS 1.2 connection.
* API Tests (Postman/Newman/Laravel UnitTests)
* ~~The delivery should be in phases, allowing for review.~~

### Phase 2
* Price update API (we can override the store)
    * Inputs

            * if not found, create new asset
        * Requires price
        * Start date - optional - let db create/current date
        * End date - optional - let db create/9999-12-31
    * Find record that overlaps provided start date
    * End date old record if needed (set to provided start date)
    * Make old record end with provided start date
    * Make current record have old record end date

* Portfolio Assets API
    * Inputs
        * Find portfolio_id by portfolio_code (to be added to model)
        * Shares - mandatory

        * End date - optional - let db create/9999-12-31

* Account Matching Report API
    * Add input date (filter output)
    * Add report of matching available
        * find matchings associated with account (see example query)
        * find transactions referring to matching rule (see example query)
- select a.nickname, mr.id, mr.name, mr.date_start, mr.date_end, mr.dollar_range_end - mr.dollar_range_start as matching, sum(t.value) as used
- from accounts a
- join account_matching_rules amr on a.id = amr.account_id
- join matching_rules mr on amr.matching_id = mr.id
- left join transactions t on t.matching_id = mr.id
- where a.fund_id = 2
- group by
-     a.nickname, mr.id;

### POSTPONED
#### Asset Changelog
* Input: only through system activity
* Asset changes should be tracked on the change historical log 
* Tracks added asset, changed asset field (no price changes)
