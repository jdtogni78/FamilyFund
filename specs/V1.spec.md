# Family Fund
A simple system to manage fund shares and composition.

## Objective and Goals

The objective is to create a first MVP of a fund shares management system.
* First goal in to have minimal functionality. 
* No graphical interface (manual inputs for some, API for others).
* Focus on code quality, good OO/separation of concepts 
* Use Java or PHP.
* Use Frameworks/ORM: Java Spring/Hibernate or some PHP Framework (Symfony/Laravel/Composer).
* The database must be  MariaDB or MySQL. Use TLS 1.2 connection.
* API Tests (Postman)
* The delivery should be in phases, allowing for review.
